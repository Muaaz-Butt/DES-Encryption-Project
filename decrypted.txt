Information security covers the tools and processes that organizations use to protect information.  This includes  policy  settings  that prevent  unauthorized  people  from accessing business  or personal  information.  InfoSec  is a growing  and evolving  field that covers  a wide range of  fields, from  network and  infrastructure  security  to testing  and auditing.  Information security  protects sensitive information from unauthorized activities, including  inspection, modification,  recording,  and any disruption  or destruc tion. The goal is to ensure  the safety and privacy  of critical  data such as customer  account  details,  financial  data or intellectual property. The  consequences  of security  incidents  include  theft of private  information,  data tampering,  and data deletion.  Attacks  can disrupt  work processes  and damage  a company reputation, and also have a tangible cost. Organizations must allocate funds for security and ensure  that they are ready  to detect,  respond  to, and proactively  prevent,  attacks  such as phishing,  malware,  viruses,  malicious  insiders,  and ransomware.
